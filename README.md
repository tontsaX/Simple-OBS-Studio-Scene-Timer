# Simple-OBS-Studio-Scene-Timer
With this grafical Java program you can monitor how long a media source in your OBS Studio scene has run. 
Unfortunately this program doesn't tell you the length of a media source in your scene.

The program uses an api developed in https://github.com/Twasi/websocket-obs-java.
